      <h2>What are you looking to gain from the first conversation?</h2>
      <a>
        When you’re trying to land your first job or looking to make a big leap, it’s helpful to 
        talk to someone who can provide guidance and answer your questions. 
        That sort of relationship can accelerate your efforts, but only if you proceed thoughtfully.
        <br><br>When  you’re looking for a formal mentoring relationship treat the process as you 
        would any major project. Take the time to prepare, and set a specific goal for what you’d like to learn and 
        achieve.
        <br><br>The most effective people come prepared with answers to common questions along with 
        the questions they wish to ask. Here is how MentorMatch approach for someone willing to mentor 
        or when someone is looking for being mentored.
        <br><br>A quick aside: A lot of us love the opportunity to help others grow, and will jump 
        at the chance if we have the time and energy. So don’t be afraid to reach out to someone you 
        think might be able to help you.<br>
      <br><br>
      </a>

      <h2>What are you looking to gain during the conversation?</h2>
      
      <a>
        Are you looking to build a personal network, or are there specific questions you hope can 
        answered? Both are perfectly valid, and it isn’t necessarily binary, but it’s good to be clear 
        about what you’re after early on. 
        <br><br>These goals are both good, but the purpose and results are very different. In our 
        experience, the best long term network is built on early conversations that are genuine and
         candid. (No different from any other valuable relationships in our lives.)

      <br><br>
      </a>

      <h2>Looking to learn?</h2>
      <a>
        Here are some questions people have asked us that prompted great conversations:
        <ul>
        <li>Do I need to specialize as a designer or should I be a generalist?</li>
        <li>I’m worried about joining a startup as the only designer for my first job; should I join 
        a bigger company instead?</li>
        <li>Do I really need to network to find a job?</li>
        <li>I eventually want to do _____. What steps should I follow to get there?</li>
        </ul>
      <br>
      </a>

      <h2>What mentors will often ask</h2>
      <a>
        We don’t have a script for these conversations, but there are some foundational topics that 
        always come up. For example:
        <ul>
        <li>How you think I can help. Seriously, why me? Is my career path similar to what you’re 
        interested in? Do you feel I can shed light on areas that you aren’t familiar with in the 
        hiring process? Maybe you feel that I can connect you with someone who can help you move 
        forward. All are 100% valid and worth talking through.</li>
        <li>If you’re looking for a new role, I want to know what you’re looking for and why. Now, you 
        may not know exactly what role to go for. That’s okay, we can dig into that, but it does 
        require that you have some general thoughts in mind. For example, if you’re a designer, are 
        you interested in landing your first design job, or are you perhaps trying to understand a 
        different, related role that might be more interesting?</li>
        <li>Your goals, both long term and short term. If you’re just starting out, you may be focused 
        on finding your first job, which is a different conversation from someone who wants to talk 
        through whether they want to become a manager or switch to a different field.</li>
        <li>Why you’ve chosen the field you’re in. It’s possible that we’ll discover you aren’t as 
        excited about it as you thought you would be. In those cases, we may switch gears to talk 
        through a different, and hopefully better, career path.</li>
        </ul>
      <br>
      </a>

      <h2>How would you like to talk</h2>
      <a>
        This may sound odd, but the clearer you are regarding how you’d like to meet, the easier it 
        will be to get things set up. Some key things to think about:
        <ul>
        <li>Meeting in person has huge benefits for communication and building a connection, but 
        scheduling can be hard. It may also be uncomfortable for some people to meet a total stranger. 
        Be open to a phone or video call initially. You can even use Slack and have a great conversation.</li>
        <li>Decide how much time you think you’ll need. A good target is 30–45 minutes, not counting 
        travel time. If you have a good conversation, you can always extend or set up another time 
        to meet.</li>
        <li>Make it convenient if you’re meeting in person. As the mentor is investing their time to 
        help you, do your best to make it as easy as possible for them. Ask which times would work 
        best and the area of town they would prefer.</li>
        <li>Think about the location. Provide a couple of options that are public, like a library or 
        coffee shop, and avoid bars. You may eventually be comfortable to meet over a beer, but now 
        isn’t the time to add alcohol to the dynamic.</li>
        <li>Be flexible. Calendars can get overbooked and on occasion, a high-priority conflict will 
        come up at the last minute, so you may have to reschedule.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <%= image_tag "tip2", class: "world img" %>
      <br>
      </a>

      <h2>What to avoid</h2>
      <a>
        <ul>
        <li>Hopefully, this is clear by now, but do not come unprepared, expecting the other person 
        to have a list of things to teach you.</li>
        <li>Don’t be slow to reply. If you get a response from someone willing to help you, jump on 
        the opportunity quickly.</li>
        <li>On the other side, be flexible on their response times. Don’t badger them if you don’t 
        receive an immediate response. If you don’t hear back within a week, send a polite follow-up.</li>
        <li>Don’t view this as a transaction. Even if someone isn’t able to give you their time now, 
        set a foundation for the future, when they may have more flexibility.</li>
        <li>Do not view this as a dating opportunity. Seriously. I’ve had friends and colleagues (all 
        women) who were put in an awkward situation where men requesting mentorship thought it was 
        more than that.</li>
        </ul><br>
      </a>

      <h2>Updates are good</h2>
      <a>
        Mentors love to hear how things are progressing. Personally, it surprises me when people 
        I’ve met don’t follow up to ask additional questions or let me know how things are going. 
        If you’ve met with someone who is interested in helping you with your career, they’ve chosen 
        to invest in you, so take advantage of the opportunity to cement the relationship.<br><br>
      </a>

      <h2>Mentorship is symbiotic</h2>
      <a>
        Building a strong relationship with a mentor can 
        pay huge dividends in the long run, as your mentors can play a key role in your network, 
        connecting you to others and possibly even providing you opportunities directly. Who knows, 
        down the road, you may be able to return the favor!
        For the mentor, the investment of time and energy is often exciting, and for many of us, 
        helping awesome people like you take their next step is a way that we give back to the 
        community and acknowledge those who’ve helped us with our careers.<br><br>
